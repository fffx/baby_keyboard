# Memory Leak Fixes

## Summary

Fixed critical memory leaks causing the app's memory usage to grow from 40MB to 260+MB over days of operation.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Recursive DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter Accumulation in `checkAccessibilityPermission()`

**Problem:**
- The `checkAccessibilityPermission()` method scheduled itself recursively every 3 seconds using `DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter`
- These scheduled tasks were never cancelled, causing an infinite accumulation of dispatch work items in memory
- Each work item retained references to `self`, creating a growing chain of closures

**Fix:**
- Introduced `permissionCheckWorkItem: DispatchWorkItem?` property to track the scheduled work
- Cancel any existing work item before scheduling a new one using `permissionCheckWorkItem?.cancel()`
- Use `[weak self]` capture in the work item closure to prevent retain cycles
- Properly cancel and nil out the work item in `stop()` and `deinit` methods

**Files Modified:**
- `BabyKeyboardLock/services/EventHandler.swift`

### 2. Uncancelled Translation Tasks in `EffectCoordinator`

**Problem:**
- When translation is enabled, each key press scheduled a `DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter` task to speak the translation 0.8 seconds later
- These tasks were never cancelled, so rapid typing would accumulate hundreds of pending translation tasks
- Each closure retained strong references to `self`, `translationService`, and `speechService`

**Fix:**
- Introduced `translationWorkItem: DispatchWorkItem?` property to track the scheduled translation work
- Cancel any existing translation work before scheduling new work
- Use `[weak self]` capture to prevent retain cycles
- Properly cancel the work item in `deinit`

**Files Modified:**
- `BabyKeyboardLock/services/EffectCoordinator.swift`

### 3. CGEvent Retain Cycles in Event Handler

**Problem:**
- Used `Unmanaged.passRetained(event)` throughout event handling code
- This increments the retain count without a corresponding release, causing CGEvent objects to leak
- Over time, this accumulated thousands of unreleased CGEvent objects

**Fix:**
- Changed all `Unmanaged.passRetained(event)` to `Unmanaged.passUnretained(event)`
- `passUnretained` returns the event without modifying its retain count, which is correct for event tap callbacks
- The system manages the event lifecycle properly when we don't interfere with retain counts

**Files Modified:**
- `BabyKeyboardLock/services/EventHandler.swift` (in `handleKeyEvent` and `globalKeyEventHandler`)

### 4. Added Proper Cleanup/Deinit Methods

**Problem:**
- No cleanup of resources when objects are deallocated
- Event taps and scheduled work items would persist even after the handler was released

**Fix:**
- Added `deinit` method to `EventHandler` to:
  - Cancel pending permission check work items
  - Disable and release event taps
  - Nil out references
- Added `deinit` method to `EffectCoordinator` to:
  - Cancel pending translation work items

**Files Modified:**
- `BabyKeyboardLock/services/EventHandler.swift`
- `BabyKeyboardLock/services/EffectCoordinator.swift`

## Testing

- Build succeeded with no compilation errors
- No linter errors introduced
- All tests passing (64 tests, 0 failures)
- Fixed timing issues in async speech tests by increasing wait times
- The changes are backward compatible and don't affect the app's functionality
- Memory should now remain stable even after days of operation

### Test Fixes Applied

Increased sleep durations in timing-sensitive tests to account for background queue dispatch:
- `SpeechServiceTests`: Increased waits from 300ms to 600ms
- `EffectCoordinatorTests`: Increased waits from 500ms to 1000ms

These changes ensure tests reliably wait for async operations to complete on background queues.

## Expected Results

After these fixes:
- Memory usage should stabilize and not grow unbounded
- The app should maintain a steady memory footprint around 40-60MB
- Scheduled work items will be properly managed and cancelled when no longer needed
- CGEvent objects will be properly released by the system

## Recommendations for Monitoring

To verify the fixes:
1. Run the app for an extended period (24-48 hours)
2. Monitor memory usage using Activity Monitor or Instruments
3. Check that memory doesn't grow beyond ~60-80MB
4. Verify that there are no leaked dispatch work items or CGEvent objects

## Additional Notes

- All fixes use Swift best practices (weak self, work item cancellation)
- The changes maintain thread safety using existing lock mechanisms
- No breaking changes to the public API
